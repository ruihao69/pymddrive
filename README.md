## Known issues

## Resolved issue
- ~~Cannot recover correct dynamics for Quasi-Floquet MD in the adiabatic representation WHEN then the time independent part of the Hamiltonian $H_0(R)$ is diagonal ($H(t, R) = H_0(R) + H_1(t, R; \Omega)$).~~ (through refactor and new equations for calculating populations for Floquet dynamics.)
